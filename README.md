# Doing the efficiency calibration for real germanium detector arrays
Four data files are included in this repository:

*GRIFFIN* array at TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada (16 germanium clover detectors, 16 x 4 = 64 germanium crystals)

*MINIBALL* array at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland (8 germanium triple cluster detectors, 8 x 3 = 24 germanium crystals)

*Soccer Ball* array at iThemba LABS, Cape Town, South Africa (13 germanium clover detectors, 13 x 4 = 52 germanium crystals)

*TIGRESS* array at TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada (12 germanium clover detectors, 12 x 4 = 48 germanium crystals)
