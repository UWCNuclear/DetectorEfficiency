# Doing your own efficiency calibration using Eu-152 data from real germanium detector arrays :-)
Four data files are included in this repository:

Soccer Ball array at iThemba LABS, Cape Town, South Africa (13 germanium clover detectors, 13 x 4 = 52 germanium crystals)

GRIFFIN array at TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada (16 germanium clover detectors, 16 x 4 = 64 germanium crystals)

TIGRESS array at TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada (12 germanium clover detectors, 12 x 4 = 48 germanium crystals)

MINIBALL array at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland (8 triple cluster detectors, 8 x 3 = 24 germanium crystals)
